# Lesson 4

In this lesson we will take a look at:

-   deleting resources through a DELETE request
-   creating a button to logout from our site
-   very basic route protection
-   using Chrome's network tab to view API requests

## Deleting resources

In this video we will add a delete button to the edit form and perform a DELETE request to remove a product.

## Logging out

We don't have a way to log out of our site yet.

In the following video we will add a button that will clear localStorage and redirect to the home page.

## Route protection

At the moment we can navigate directly to the add and edit pages even when logged out.

In this video we will add a simple check to see if the JWT exists in localStorage. If not, we'll redirect to the home page.

## Chrome's network tab

Here we will see how we can view the data and headers sent in every API request using the XHR filter in Chrome's network tab in the dev tools.
