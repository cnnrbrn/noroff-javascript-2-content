# Lesson 3

In this lesson we will look at:

-   saving list state using object properties
-   updating and saving array item text values
-   clearing a list with a button

## Saving list state

In this video the items we work with in the array will be objects so that we can save the state of the array.

We will use a property in each object to mark an item as completed and save the array in localStorage.

We'll use the `findIndex` method to determine with item to update.

## Updating list item values

Here we will update and save the text value of each item in an array of objects.

## Clearing a list

In this video we'll add a button that clears all items in a list.

We'll remove the array from localStorage and as well as the HTML created from the array.
