# Lesson 2

In this lesson we will look at:

-   What DOM events are
-   the click event
-   the remainder operator
-   the onchange event

## Introduction to Events

When something happens in the browser - such as a page loading, a form being submitted or a user clicking a button, the DOM sends an `Event`.

We can write code to respond to that event.

Some examples of events include:

-   `click` - when the mouse button is clicked
-   `keydown` - when any key is pressed
-   `keyup` - when any key is released
-   `mouseover` - when the mouse cursor moves over a DOM element or its children elements
-   `mouseout` - when the mouse cursor moves off an element
-   `scroll` - when a form is submitted

You can find a full list of events [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

An event is an object with properties.

The video below is an introduction to DOM events and the `click` event in particular.

## The remainder operator

The `remainder` operator `%`, sometimes referred to as the `modulus` operator, returns the remaining integer value after dividing two integers:

```js
const remainder = 5 % 2;
// remainder will equal 1
```

## The `onchange` event

The following video looks at the `onchange` event of `select` element and how to create HTML inside that event function.

In the next a video a `setTimeout` function is used to mimic a loading state when creating the HTML.
