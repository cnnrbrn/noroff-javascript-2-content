# Lesson 1

In this lesson we will look at refresher videos on creating HTML from objects.

After that we will:

-   look at the push method on arrays
-   creating HTML lists from dynamic arrays

## Creating HTML from objects

The following three videos look at creating HTML from objects.

If this is something you are comfortable with you can skip ahead to the array `push` method.

### HTML from a single object

This video looks at creating HTML from a single objcet and adding default values for missing properties.

## HTML from an array of objects

In this video HTML is created by looping through an array of objects.

## The array push method

The `push` method can be used to add an item to the end of an array.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);

console.log(arr);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## HTML lists from dynamic arrays

In this video we will use a text input to add a new item to an array, and build an HTML list from the array.

We will also add a click event listener to each item to mark it as completed with a CSS class.
