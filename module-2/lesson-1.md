# Lesson 1

In this lesson we will look at:

-   callback functions - passing functions into functions
-   forEach loops
-   the setTimeout method
-   the setInterval method

## Functions as arguments - passing functions into functions

Often called `callbacks`, it is very common to pass functions as arguments to other functions and have the receiving function execute them.

## forEach loops

The `forEach` loop is an alternative to the `for` loop.

When you use a `forEach` function, you will pass in a function to be executed by the `forEach` function for each item in the array you are looping over.

It does have some limitations though, such as the inability to use `break` or `continue`.

## setTimeout

The `setTimeout` method (function) is used to execute a function after a specified period of time.

It has the following structure:

```js
setTimeout(function () {
    // do something
}, 1000);
```

It has two required arguments:

1. the function to be executed
2. the delay - the delay in milliseconds before the function is executed

## setInterval

The `setInterval` method is similar to `setTimeout` but it executes a function at a certain interval until it is cleared.

It has the following structure:

```js
setInterval(function () {
    // do something
}, 1000);
```
