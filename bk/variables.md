## Variables

The five types of JavaScript variables we are concerned with are:

### string

Any value inside single or double quotes is a string.

Strings can also be created with backticks.

### number

We can use the following operators to perform operations on numbers:

-   `+` - addition
-   `-` - subtraction
-   `*` - multiplication
-   `/` - division
-   `%` - remainder operator. Returns the remainder after a division operation.

### boolean

Either true or false.

### null and undefined

Both indicate the absence of a value.
