# Lesson 3 - The filter and find methods

In this lesson we'll look at using the very useful `filter` and `find` methods on arrays.

## filter

The filter method is used to create a new array from an existing array that the filter method is called on.

The filter method takes a function as an argument. This function receives each item in the array as argument. If the function returns true, the item is added to the new array.

### filter method with numbers

The Scrimba below takes a look at using the filter method on an array of numbers.

## find

The find method is similar to the filter method, though it only returns a single item (or undefined) rather than an array of items.

## filter example

In the video below, the filter method is used to filter a static array of objects on a `keyup` event.

## filter example with API data

The video below builds on the one above, adding data from an API call and moving the code into reusable functions.
