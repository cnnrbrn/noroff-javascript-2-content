## Building a favourites page

In this video will build a favourites page using localStorage.

On the index page, clicking on an icon button will add or remove an item from an array in localStorage.

On the favourites page, the items in storage will be retrieved and displayed.

Because localStorage can only store string values, we'll use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` to set and get the array of favourites to and from storage.
