# Module Assignment 1

# Brief

Use only plain JavaScript for this MA.

This is the API endpoint you will use:

```
https://t9jt3myad3.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/api/products
```

## Level 1

Connect to the API and display the name and price property of each result.

Add an input that filters the results by maximum price. This can be on the keyup event on the input, or the click event of a button.

If the user enters `50`, only results with a price of 50 or less should be displayed.

## Level 2

Add a button or icon to each result.

Clicking on the button should add or remove the result from a `wishlist` array stored in localStorage.

Display the contents of the array on a page called `wishlist.html`.
