# Lesson 2 - Imports and exports using modules

We can split our code up into files using modules.

In order to import code from another file we need to export it first.

There are two kinds of exports:

## Named exports

Named exports are exported with the `export` keyword and imported using their name between braces.

One file can contain many named exports.

You can alias a named export usign the `as` keyword.

## Default exports

Default exports are exported with the `export default` keywords and imported without braces.

When you import a default export, you can import it using any name, the name you use in the import is really just an alias.

## Navigating directories

### Go up a folder

`../` - go back (or up) one directory (folder) from the current directory.

You can use several of these, the below will go back three folders:

`../../../`

### Look in the current folder

`./` - look in the current folder for the path
